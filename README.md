In this project, I have created a website that gives information about the spread of COVID-19  all over the world. Website fetches real-time data from a REST API. It uses Mapbox to plot it on a World map
The map has three coloured markers red, green and yellow.

•	Green colour specifies that the number of patients in a country is less than 100

•	Yellow colour specifies that the number of patients is between 100 and 1000  

•	Four shades of Red darker the shade of red more the number of COVID-19 infected patients

The website gives the data about the total number of cases, new cases, it also calculates the death rate and the recovery rate and also mentions about when the data was last updated.
I have used Github pages to deploy the website.
